# About Me

Hi, my name is Marcus and I am a self-employed software engineer living and working remotely in Richmond, VA. I grew up in a small farm town known as Meadows of Dan and graduated from [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/) with a dual degree in entrepreneurial management and marketing. I'm a self-taught developer and have been coding for over five years.

I specialize in building enterprise web platforms using JavaScript (TypeScript nowadays!), Node, GraphQL, and React. I've been lucky to work with a lot of brilliant engineers along that way at some of the largest companies in the world like [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en.html) and [PwC](https://www.pwc.com/).

I am currently contracting at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) as a lead application developer architecting a fintech platform containing multiple SaaS solutions surrounding financial crime. I build my own products on the side (maybe you've heard of [Guess the Throne](/products/guess-the-throne))and have started to blog full of helpful things I’ve learned over the years to share what I’ve learned. I also speak at a variety of events to support the ever-growing tech community.

When I'm not coding, I'm in nature exploring, hiking, fishing, or biking.

## Speaking

I've started to speak more and give back to the community. I like speaking on application architecture, design patterns, and the JAM stack.

### [Monorepos: Friend or Foe](https://monorepo.marcuswood.io/)

A in-depth exploration of monorepos using Lerna and Yarn. Learn what they are, how they work, and the pitfalls you may face while adopting one.

### JAM in 15: How to build and deploy a JAM stack app in 15 minutes, 2020

An overview of the JAM stack for beginners using Gatsby and Netlify. The talk is 100% in the editor walking through how to bootstrap your application, add a blog, and deploy all within 15 minutes.
