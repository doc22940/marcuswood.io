## About

The swift transformation of the video-rental industry (R.I.P
brick-and-mortar movie rental companies) left a void within the hearts
of many gamers. As the market moved towards digital entertainment
streaming, the ability to rent anything from new video games to
childhood classics was lost.

Enter Gamebyrd - an internal project with a simple concept: deliver
games, consoles, and accessories to your door as quickly as a pizza.
