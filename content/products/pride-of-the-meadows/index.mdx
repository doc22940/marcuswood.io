## Pride of the Meadows

A transformation in consumer preferences has increased the demand for
fresh, local produce in a big way. Wholesalers and grocers alike are
having to adapt to meet this new market of local growers. During this
change, we met Wood’s Produce, a family-owned regional wholesaler, and
helped to craft a cohesive brand with a digital-first strategy.

## Creating a Message

From the start, we wanted to create a brand consistent with the
heritage of the company. Through interviews with employees of the
company and surveying current customers we created Pride of the
Meadows. The parent company, [Wood's Produce](https://woodsproduce.com/),
has a rich history of growing crops in the small town of Meadows of
Dan, VA. Creating a brand that pairs the rich history of the company
with a popular design patterns was a perfect match.

Next, we created a message to build the brand around. We boiled down
the value proposition of the brand into one sentence.

  Local fruits and vegetables to your neighborhood grocery store in 72
  hours or less.

The details that followed – the logo, visual style, typography, etc. –
supported the message and purpose this brand served. More simply put,
we made it **memorable** and we made it **matter**.

## Research

The information gathered throughout this process was vital to
the success of the brand. Not only did the research provide
answers to the questions we built out, but it also opened doors
to answers for questions we had not yet thought up. There were
lots of moving parts, and this made our workflow – shown to the
right – that much more dynamic.

We came, we analyzed, and we conquered.

      To start, we conducted interviews with stakeholders. This
      was vital in order to gain an understanding of the company's
      vision for the brand.

      We put together a list of potential names during a series of
      white-boarding sessions.

    With three stellar name choices on the table, we turned to our
    designers to work their magic. We decided to create logos with
    each name option before user testing so we could provide all
    logo options for the testing.

    The logos were sent out to users via a survey within the area
    to gather data on consumer preferences. Showing all of the
    logo ideas allowed us to keep the survey short and generate
    more responses. It is not uncommon for our respondents to say
    they prefer a logo with a different name. In fact, that stress
    is often intentional, and we love getting that type of data to
    work through.

    At the end of this process, Pride of the Meadows felt the most
    personal. It not only tested well but also added a sense of
    comfort to the brand. There is something to be said about
    that.

## Print + Digital

We admit it – we are perfectionists. That is why consistency in design
is the pillar of our creative structure. Delivering a consistent
message regardless of the channel is crucial. For this project, every
element in the bag was designed with digital marketing in mind.
Components of the packaging were created in a way that could be
mirrored online. From color choice, to iconography, to marrying the
brand’s physical appearance and digital presence- this was all a
priority.

## Tech

If we have learned anything from the internet age and the
blogging craze, it is that when food and the web are paired,
they create exceedingly successful results. We decided to
capitalize on this by driving traffic to the website through
delicious recipes.

With that in mind, we designed a mobile-first website for a
variety of devices – and then we took it a step further. ‘The
Pride of the Meadows’ website employs some of the newest web
technology available, turning the site into a Progressive Web
App with an offline content strategy. No matter where the user
is, they have access to the recipes they have previously viewed.

To maintain consistency in print and on the web, we chose
GatsbyJS. This system uses React for its templating so that
creating reusable components is a breeze. With the added benefit
of being a statically generated site, we saw increased search
friendliness of all recipes and pages within the site. Mission
accomplished.
