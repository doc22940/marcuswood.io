## Suri

Over the past year, I have gotten more and more into financial markets and trading algorithms. After reading [Trend Following](https://www.amazon.com/Trend-Following-5th-Fortune-Markets/dp/1119371872) by Michael Cohen I was ready to build the next big algo with the best sharpe ratio in the business! It's definitely not that easy, and any idea you've thought off a hedge fund has likely already tried or is currently using.

But what about the small ball algos? The ones that aren't big enough for hedge funds to spend time on, but still has considerable upside potential? That's what Suri is for. It's a playground to create trading algos, backtest them, and provide an enterprise grade UI to measure how it's doing.

## Donnie Pump

The first algo written into Suri uses the natural language processing to dictate any audio in realtime to search for stocks, return the current pricing information, document the trend for the day, and allow for hasty buy/sell decisions.

### Motivation

With the advent of the coronavirus the stock market has been turbulent to say the least. One of the more interesting data points is just how much bearing the news has on the market and some stocks in particular like Boeing.

Watching the press event one evening I noticed that a lot of stocks were called out by name and decided to check my app (shameless Robinhood user but now TOS ðŸš€) only to see them going up by [huge margins](https://fortune.com/2020/03/13/walgreens-target-becton-dickinson-stocks-rise-trump-press-conference-coronavirus/). It wasn't extremely surprising considering the talk of bailouts and helping out these huge corporations, but I wondered it there was a way to be faster than the market.

## Algo

The premise of the algo is pretty simple. Use speech dictation to decode stock keywords faster than the market can and make a purchase decision before the pump and sell at the top. Since things are moving pretty quick the orders placed were bracket orders that would sell if the stock tanked (mentioned in a negative sentiment) and if they exceeded a certain threshold. I know it's a cardinal sin to not let your winners run, but with the pace of the information we thought it was prudent to allow for some automation.

Perhaps the best things about this algo is that it can run off of any audio source. A TV, YouTube, a public speech, or an everyday conversation. That becomes more important when live streams of events are much faster for some networks. We noticed that CNN was about 15 seconds faster than YouTube live and that's a lot of potential profit.

## Results

Unfortunately that daily press conferences that would pump the stock market were moved to after hours by the time we had backtested and built the platform. We have ran it on paper accounts with some success (all screenshots above are from paper accounts not my actual portfolio amounts).

## Tech

The platform was built using React, Typescript, Styled Components, BlueprintJS, Socket-IO, Node, and Express. This is a sandbox for personal trading algos using the [Alpaca API](https://alpaca.markets/) so it's built and ran locally. If you're interested in making this open source and adding more algorithms to it please reach out!

I couldn't have made this product a reality without the help of my friend [Aaron Decker](https://www.ard.ninja/). He has a ton of knowledge about trading and the financial markets that helped make this system a reality. We worked together on building the platform and backtesting the first algo. Check out [his blog](https://www.ard.ninja/) for more details on Donnie Pump and other algos he has written!
