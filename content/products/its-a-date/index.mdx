Online dating is flooded with mobile apps that focus on throwing
potential matches into "Yes" and "No" bins. It is impersonal and
prevents users from interacting with people they might have found
real, romantic connections with given just a little bit more time.

Many of the popular dating apps attract people with decidedly
unromantic intentions. Shocking and uncomfortable bios and pick-up
lines, blunt propositions, racy pictures...it is pretty clear when the
other user has no skin in the game. Even when you find someone
attractive and pleasant to talk to, there always remains the question:
What is their end goal? Just a chat buddy or an actual romantic
partner?

**Introducing It's a Date. It's a Date encourages human connections through
shared experiences. We thoughtfully curate dates to make users excited not
only for the person they are meeting, but also the overall experience they are
agreeing to be a part of.**

## User Research and Idea Generation

Our staff was comprised entirely of people within our target
demographic- young professionals [20-34] living in or near Washington
D.C. We used big-name dating apps for years and felt like there was
something missing. A majority of our ideas came directly as responses
to our own qualms with existing apps. Our own social circles aided
early ideation and user research, and made our eventual user testing
sessions self-sustaining in terms of participant recruiting.

## Development

**Frontend:** React Native with Expo and Styled Components.
We loved using this stack for mobile apps because it gave us the
ability to get started creating quickly and did not create
guardrails for the design team. They were able to create the
exact experience people were asking for without worrying about
views not being technically feasible or taking an unrealistic
amount of time. Styled components felt right at home in React
Native, allowing us to compose complex themes with custom React
components in perfect harmony.

**Backend:** Node, Express, Typescript, Firebase Cloud
Firestore, and Google Cloud Platform. There is not a backend
stack out there that allows you to create real-time applications
faster. We created our messaging feature in one day! However,
that speed came at the cost of in-depth domain expertise to the
interworkings of Firebase and the Google Cloud Platform. The
flexibility you take for granted in more traditional
environments like scheduling, backups, integration testing, and
other operations took a bit more effort to implement.

**Dev ops:** We created three environments: Development,
Staging, and Production. Development served as a playground for
new features and allowed our development team to try certain
features on phones before letting our design and functional team
touch it in staging. Once features from Staging were tested and
verified, we could deploy from our continuous integration to
production.

## The Landing Page

With app development nearly complete and users asking about app, we
created a landing page to generate hype around the product. The emails
we captured were leveraged for user testing events and beta testing
the app in its current state. With more feedback under our belt, we
launched a blog and CMS for team members to write about cool events
happening in the DC area.

## Administrative Portal

Adhereing to our design principles, we launched without many features
users take for granted in a dating app, like blocking functionality
and a support portal. Instead, we opted to create a personal concierge
that would route messages directly to the team to take care of any
issue. Not only did it align with our app's goal of being more
personal to our audience, but it allowed us to cut the development
runway by three weeks.

The admin portal was the place for our team to chat directly with
users of the app, create new dates, and send push notifications. This
was 100% integrated into the application and gave us fine grained
control over how we interacted with users.

## Design Thinking

For an internal app venture, this was our first experience tackling a
domain as intimate as online dating and wanted to get it right. We
enlisted the help of the [SIDO Innovation](http://www.sidoinnovation.com/)
team to help us run design thinking and facilitation sessions with
friends and beta users. Through their proven techniques, we were able
to pull out crucial insights on what users wanted and to see if we
were on the mark with our hypothesis - something has to change in
online dating.

<FancyTile>
  Using proven design thinking techniques was crucial to the launch of It's a
  Date.
</FancyTile>

Each session lasted roughly three hours with drinks and apps provided.
What was most striking is how quickly people opened up about their
frustrations with using the app and shared their experiences with the
team.

## Testing

1. **Programmatic testing:** This involved taking the business rules
   established and writing tests in the code to make sure there were no
   errors. Errors like users getting matched up to the wrong gender or
   someone's message going to the wrong recipient. This made it crucial
   to make sure things worked as expected, especially on the backend.
   On top of tests writing for the logic of the application, we wrote
   the entire backend in Typescript to help us harden the code against
   any potential defects.
2. **UI Testing:** All of the team members assisted in running
   through the app and scanning for potential defects in our Staging
   environment before deploying new code to Production.
3. **Focus Group Testing:** Immediately after launch, we offered
   It's a Date to a user testing group of 20 participants. Users were
   instructed to move through the main event flow with specific aid
   only offered when requested. Points of approval, disapproval, and
   suggestion were all noted by category, then ranked by their urgency
   for continued development.

## Launch

After flow improvements and other design tweaks were implemented, It's
a Date was ready for submission to incubators, accelerators, and other
funding sources.

Branding became a core focus as the specific voice of It's a Date
began to emerge across press materials and internal app copy. Writing
shifted from a single copywriterâ€™s perspective to include internal
insights from developers and other technical staff.

  />
</ResponsiveVideo>

Our launched video amassed over 2,000 views in two days with an
average engagement rate of 40% (industry average is 2%). Social
ambassadors were recruited through our user testing sessions, which
aided us in our initial user base growth. Brand ambassadors naturally
fell in our target demographic due to our testing session selection
parameters.
